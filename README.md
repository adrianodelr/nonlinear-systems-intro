#### Examples and definitions in the context of linear systems (but useful for nonlinear ones)
Strogatz explains the concept of the <font color="red">**phase space**</font> by starting from an easy two dimensional linear systems. As e.g. the *simple harmonic oscillator* characterised by 

$$\begin{align}
    & \dot{x} = v \\
    & \dot{v} = - \frac{k}{m} x 
\end{align}$$

A vector $(\dot{x},\dot{v})= (v,-\omega^2 x)$  with  $\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m}$ is assigned to each point $(x,v)$. This can be represented as a <font color="red">**vector field**</font>. 

```julia
linear_harmonic_oscillator_vector_field(;xlims=(-1,1),ylims=(-1,1),xh=0.15, yh=0.15)
```

It can be imagined as a fluid field, with local velocity $(\dot{x},\dot{v}) = (v,-\omega^2 x)$. A trajectory of an imaginary particle we place in the field starts at the point where we set it in the field, a point $(x_0, v_0)$ called <font color="red">**phase point**</font> (generally all points in the phase space).

The origin is a special point. A phase point placed there would remain motionless, as $(\dot{x},\dot{v})=0$ when $(x,v)=0$. The origin is therefore a <font color="red">**fixed point**</font>.

A phase point starting anywhere else, would circulate aroung the origin and pass again through its starting point. Such a trajectory, where something passes again through the starting point, forms a <font color="red">**closed orbit**</font>. 


```julia
linear_harmonic_oscillator_phase_portrait(;num_traj=5, tf=10, h=0.01,xlims=(-2,2),ylims=(-1,1),xh=0.05, yh=0.05)
```
<img width=700 height=400 style='object-fit: contain; height: auto;' src="nonlinear-systems-intro_files/nonlinear-systems-intro_4_0.png"/>

Here we can see a picture of some random trajectories in the phase space, all forming closed orbits. This kind of plot is calles <font color="red">**phase portrait**</font>.

What do the concepts of fixed points and closed orbits further tell us ?

- At the fixed point $(x,v)=0 $, the system is in a <font color="red">*static equilibrium*</font> . This means the mass will remain there forever because the forces are balanced.
- The periodic orbits correspond to periodic motions, in this case the oscillation of the mass (up and down) 

Some more of the differential geometry-specific language is explained by means of the <font color="red">**uncoupled**</font> linear system

$$\begin{bmatrix}
    \dot{x}\\
    \dot{y}\\
\end{bmatrix}= 
\begin{bmatrix}
    a & 0\\
    0 & -1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
    x\\
    y\\
\end{bmatrix}$$ 

Peforming the matrix multiplication and solving the decoupled equations by direct integration leads to:

$$\begin{align*}
    & x(t) = x_0 e^{at} \\ 
    & y(t) = y_0 e^{-t} \\ 
\end{align*}$$

From these equations we can see, that $y(t)$ always decays exponentially, while the decay of $x(t)$ depends on the factor $a$. Below the the phase plots for differents values of $a$ are depicted. 


```julia
uncoupled_linear_system_phase_portraits(;a = [-1.5, -1, -0.25, 0, 0.5], tr = 0:0.001:4, titles = ["a)","b)","c)","d)","e)"])
```

A direction field has arrows instead of lines. Visibly the trajectories follow local slopes depicted by the lines. 

The **existence and uniqueness theorem** tells us, that the existence and uniqueness of a solution is guaranteed, as long as $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$ is continuously differentiable (no mathematical definition of the theorem here). This theorem has one important implication:
- two (or more) different trajectories can not intersect.

Otherwise from the crossing point as starting point two different trajectories (i.e. two solutions) would emerge. This is the reason the phase plots look always neat. From this observation other important implications follow:
- if there is a closed orbit $C$ in the phase plane, a trajectory $\mathbf{x}(t)$ with $\mathbf{x}_0$ inside $C$ has to remain within the closed, bounded region. 
- if additionally there are fixed points within $C$, $\mathbf{x}(t)$ might approach the fixed points.
- if there is no fixed points, $\mathbf{x}(t)$ must approach a closed orbit. This is the <font color="red">**Pointcar√©-Bendixson theorem**</font> for vector fields on the plane.  

##### Linearization around a fixed point

<font color="red">**Linearization**</font> is done as usual by a <font color="red">**Taylor approximation**</font>:
We linearize the system

$$ \dot{x} = f(x,y), \quad \dot{y} = g(x,y) $$ 

around the fixed point $(x^*, y^*)$ 

$$ f(x) =  f(x^*,y^*)  + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x - x^*)  + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(y - y^*) + O((x - x^*)^2, (y - y^*)^2,(y - y^*)(x - x^*)) $$ 

since it is a fixed point $f(x^\ast,y^\ast)=0$ and $(x - x^\ast)$ and $(y - y^\ast)$ are very small, we can disregard $f(x^*,y^*)$ and the quadratic terms $O$. Doing the same for $g(x,y)$ we finally arrive at

$$\begin{align*}
    & f(x,y) =  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x - x^\ast)  + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(y - y^\ast) \\
    & g(x,y) =  \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}(x - x^\ast)  + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}(y - y^\ast) \\
\end{align*}$$

If we linearize the system around a fixed point, neglecting the quadratic rest from the tayler expansion, the linearized system will predict the correct type of fixed point, as long as its a **saddle**, **node**, or **spiral**. Other cases like <font color="red">**centers**</font> may require some adapted techniques, which can be taken from the Strogatz book. 

When not interested in the geometry of trajectories but only in stability properties, fixed points can be characterized as:

**Robust cases**:
- *Repellers*/ *sources*: For both eigenvalues $Re(\lambda)>0$ 
- *Attractors*/ *sinks*: For both eigenvalues $Re(\lambda)<0$ 
- *Saddles*: One eigenvalues $Re(\lambda)<0$, other eigenvalues $Re(\lambda)>0$ 

**Marginal cases**:
- *Centers*: Both eigenvalues $Re(\lambda)=0$ (purely imaginary) (see phase portrait of the simple harmonic oscillator)
- *Higher-order* and *non-isolated fixed points*: At least one eigenvalues $Re(\lambda)=0$ 

If $Re(\lambda) \neq 0$ for both eigenvalues, the fixed point is also called <font color="red">**hyperbolic**</font>. At this kind of fixed point, the stability is unaffected by small nonlinear terms. In other words, the stability is accurately predicted by the linearization. This can be generalized to n-th order systems:  
- If all the eigenvalues of the linarized system (at the fixed point) lie off the imaginary axis (i.e. $Re(\lambda_i) \neq 0 $ for $i = 1,\dots,n$), the fixed point is **hyperbolic**

The preservation of the stability property is substantiated by the <font color="red">**Hartman-Grobman theorem**</font>, which reveals that a local phase portrait, near a hyperbolic fixed point is <font color="red">**topologically equivalent**</font> to the phase portrait of the linearization. Topologically equivalent means there is a <font color="red">**homeomorphism**</font> (continuous deformation with continuous inverse), mapping the local phase portrait onto the phase portrait of the linearization. This implies that proportions between trajectories and their direction (sense of time) is preseved.


#### (Energy) conservative systems

Many important mechanical second order systems come from Newton's law $F=ma$. One example is a particle of mass $m$ moving in x-direction:

$$ m \ddot{x} = F(x) $$

where $F(x)$ is some nonlinear force. As $F$ is not dependent on $\dot{x}$, which means there is no damping or friction involved. The force is also not dependent on $t$ (i.e. time-independent). In this case it can be shown that the system is <font color="red">*energy conservative*</font>. The Force is defined as $F(x)=-dV/dx$, where $V(x)$ is the <font color="red">**potential energy**</font>. The equation of motion can thus be written as

$$ m \ddot{x}  + \frac{dV}{dx} = 0 $$

Multiplying the equation by $\dot{x}$ and applying the chain rule in reverse, reveals there is a quantity that stays constant over time:

$$ m \dot{x} \ddot{x}  + \frac{dV}{dx}\dot{x} = 0 \implies 
    \frac{d}{dt}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{1}{2} m\dot{x}^2 + V(x)\\
\end{bmatrix} $$

The system <font color="red">*total energy*</font> 

$$ E = \frac{1}{2} m\dot{x}^2 + V(x) $$

is, for any given solution $x(t)$, constant w.r.t. time. Systems that are governed by such a conserved quantity are <font color="red">**conservative systems**</font>. In more general words, given a system $\mathbf{\dot{x}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})$, the real-valued and continuous function $E(x)$ is a <font color="red">**conserved quantity**</font>, if it is constant on trajectories (i.e. $dE/dt = 0$). To prevent someone from finding a function like $E(x) \equiv 0$ for every system (every system would accordingly be conservative), a second requirement for $E(x)$ is to be *nonconstant* on every open set, which defines a region in space (opposed to a trajectory, which defined a position over time).     

We can show, using above defintion, that <ins>a conservative system cannot have any attracting fixed points</ins>. To this end, shortly the term <font color="red">**basin of attraction**</font> is explained:
- given an attracting fixed point $\mathbf{\dot{x}}$, we can define its **basin of attraction** a the set of initial conditions $\mathbf{x}_0$ sucht that $\mathbf{x}(t) \rightarrow \mathbf{x}^*$ when $t \rightarrow \infty$.
- a basin of attraction can be separated from other basins of attraction by a <font color="red">**basin boundary**</font>. The latter can be a **stable manifold** (explained in first section) leading to some saddle point
- if the **basin boundary** consists of more segments/ trajectories, these are commonly called  <font color="red">**separatrices**</font>.
- basins and their boundaries partition the phase space into regions where trajectories exhibit different long-term behaviour and are therefore important. 

With this definition at hand, we can say that, supposed there is an attracting fixed point $\mathbf{x}^*$, all the points in the corresponding basin of attraction would have to be at the same energy level as $E(\mathbf{x}^*)$. So, $E(\mathbf{x})$ must be a constant function for every $\mathbf{x}$ in the basin. But at the same time, there is the requirement for the conserved quantity to be nonconstant over all open sets (basin of attraction is an open set), so these things contradict each other.

Instead of attracting fixed points, one generally finds saddles and centers in conservative systems. One such example is a particle (mass $m=1$) in a double-well potential $V(x) = - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{4}x^4$. Follwing the procedure in the above example, the force is $-dV/dx=x-x^3$ and accordingly the equation of motion is 

$$\ddot{x}  = x - x^3 $$

Which can be brought in first order form by doing a substitution 

$$\begin{align*}
& \dot{x} = y\\
& \dot{y} = x-x^3\\
\end{align*}$$

From this representation we can determine the fixed points, which are a **saddle** in the origin and two **centers** at ($\pm 1,0$). This can be deduced from the eigenvalues of the linearization at these points and the above classification scheme. This can also be recognized from the streamline plot of the phase plane in b) below.

In a) the <font color="red">**energy surface**</font> of the system is depicted, coming from the according energy function 

$$ E = \frac{1}{2}y^2 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{4}x^4 $$

It can be computed as in the previous mass particel example. Interestingly, a trajectory in the phase space can be deduced from the projection of the <font color="red">**contours**</font> of the **energy surface** onto the phase plane, as shown in b). The contours represent levels of constant energy and as the system is energy conservative, a trajectory in the phase plane will always follow the projection of the according contour. 

The indicated trajectory orbits show that almost all solutions are periodic. Excemption are the equilibrium solutions (white dots) and two special trajectories that seem to start and end at the origin (blue lines). As they start and end at the same fixed point, they are categorized as <font color="red">**homoclinic orbits**</font> (common in conservative systems). These are not periodic, as trajectories are forever trying to approach the origin.

Tip from Strogatz: 
- It can be helpful to think of the flow as happening on the energy surface rather than in the phase plane, but they would run *around* the surface as they must stay at a constant height E(x,y) - corresponding to the constant energy level. 

#### (Time) reversible systems

Mechanical systems of the form $m \ddot{x} = F(x)$ have a <font color="red">**time-reversal symmetry**</font>, which means when replacing $t \rightarrow -t$ the second derivative $\ddot{x}$ remains unchanged. Only the velocity $\dot{x}$ changes sign. In the phase plane this corresponds to a reflection of the trajectory on the x-axis and a reversal of the flow direction.   

#### The Pendulum

Departing from the equation of motion for a pendulum

$$ \frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{L} sin(\theta) = 0  $$

to simplify things we further assume $\frac{g}{L}=1$

$$\ddot{\theta} + sin(\theta) = 0 $$

The system is reversible and also we can find a conservatived quantity $E$ by multiplying with $\dot{\theta}$

$$\frac{d}{dt}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{1}{2}\dot{\theta}^2 - cos(\theta)
    \end{bmatrix} 
    = \frac{d}{dt} E(\theta, \dot{\theta}) = 0 $$

The left hand side a) shows the energy surface and the projection of its contours onto the phase plane which is given by 

$$ \dot{\theta} = v \text{,} \quad \dot{v} = - sin(\theta)$$

on the phase portait b) one can recognize two saddle points and a center at the origin. The center corresponds to the lowest possible energy state ($E=-1$), it is a neutrally stable equilibrium. The small orbits around it correspond to small oscillations around the equilibrium point, these are called <font color="red">**liberations**</font>.
